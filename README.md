## CXR Anomaly Detection
In this project I have developed a model, based on a CNN to analyze a **Chest X-Ray** and predict if it contains signs of disease or not.

In the project I have used PNG images 102x1024 coming from **NIH Chest X-Ray-14** dataset

### Dataset
The dataset used is saved in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/luigisaetta/cxr-tfrec256-may2020
